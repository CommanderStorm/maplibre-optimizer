# MapLibre Optimiser

This repo is a Proof of concept research prototype on how to optimise MapLibre based maps.

> [!WARNING]
> The current state is not ready for production use.
> Many optimizations are not fully validated, unimplemented or ineffective.
>
> If you are considering this repo, please consider [`vtoptimizer`](https://github.com/maplibre/vtoptimizer) instead.
> The research grant, under which this repo is developed is concluding in April 2026, until then no stability is expected.
